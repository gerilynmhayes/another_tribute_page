  <h3 id="headline">Here's a timeline of Chrissie Hynde's life:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1951</strong> - Born in Akron, Ohio</li>
    <li><strong>1973</strong> - Chrissie Hynde moved to London where she became a music journalist for <i>NME</i>. She claims to have written "half-baked philosophical drivel and nonsensical tirades."</li>
    <li><strong>1975</strong> - Hynde went back to Ohio, Cleveland to be specific. That wouldn't last long.</li>
    <li><strong>1976</strong> - Hynde auditioned for and played in a series of bands. However, none of them panned out.</li>
    <li><strong>1978</strong> - The Pretenders was formed by Hynde and Pete Farndon (bass guitar, vocals). They connected with James Honeyman-Scott (guitar, vocals, keyboards) and Martin Chambers (drums, vocals, percussion) to form one of the best bands of all time (in my humble opinion).</li>
    <li><strong>1979</strong> - "Stop Your Sobbing"/"The Wait" was released in January 1979 by producer Nick Lowe. The second single "Kid" was released in July 1979. "Brass In Pocket" was released in November 1979. The rest is history.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>"I saw her play in Central Park [in August 1980, performing with the Pretenders]. She was amazing: the only woman I'd seen in performance where I thought, yeah, she's got balls, she's awesome! ... It gave me courage, inspiration, to see a woman with that kind of confidence in a man's world."</p>
